# Programming Talks

### Names to look out for

To make choosing the right speakers a tad easier, let me give you a quick overview
over my favourite speakers in no particular order:

* **Scott Meyers** (C++): Scott Meyers is one of the most entertaining and knowledgeable
speaker when it comes to all things C++. His talks cover a variety of topics, from type
inference to API design and cache lines.
* **Rich Hickey** (Clojure): I am not a Clojure programmer, but I like reasoning about
and building programming languages. Even if you don't, Rich Hickeys talks are inspiring
and thought-provoking. Whenever he talks about the fundamentals of programming and reasoning,
you are sure to learn a ton. Oh, and if you program in Clojure, you have no excuse for
not watching this guy speak.
* **David Nolen** (Clojure/Clojurescript): The core maintainer of Clojurescript. His talks
mostly focus on immutability and share a bit of their structure. He doesn't get boring, though,
and is another very smart person with deep insights in such fields as immutability.
* **David Beazley** (Python): The person who singlehandedly made me a Pythonista. Need I say
more? He has a lot of low-level knowledge about Python and makes poking at the Python interpreter
seem more fun than it actually is.
* **Joe Armstrong** (Erlang): One of the few people I actually had the chance to see live already.
He is a funny, witty and smart guy and if you want to learn about Erlang, watch his talks. Most
of his talks are also very beginner-friendly.
* **Brandon Rhodes** (Python): Yet another Pythonista. His talks are enjoyable, enlightening
and his way of talking is *just enjoyable* - you might think that is secondary, but it is really
important. His talk on Tolkien is one of the most enjoyable diversions on this list (and a bit off-topic,
mind you).
* **Philip Wadler** (Haskell, Theory, ...): Incredibly knowledgeable gentleman. If you use generics
in Java, you owe that to him. If you use Haskell and/or monads, you probably already know him,
but in case you do not, try to change that fact. He makes theoretical computer science more
approachable than it actually is, and that is a good thing.
* **Zach Tellman** (Clojure, Theory): Another person in the Clojure landscape
with interesting, important insights that do not only apply to Clojure. His
talks on theory should inspire you to think more deeply about what you are
doing, which is probably the most important thing to take away from anything
ever.
